# Benefits of Keeping It Simple with Tooling Around Locally Hosted Ollama

Keeping it simple with build tooling around locally hosted Ollama offers numerous advantages that enhance efficiency and user experience. By focusing on straightforward solutions like a Gradio-based single-page code review app or a chatbot using tools such as chromadb or PostgreSQL's pgvector, developers can significantly streamline their workflows. These apps provide intuitive interfaces that reduce complexity, enabling quick setup and easier maintenance.

A simple command-line code review application leveraging decision prompts to evaluate entire codebases further enhances productivity by facilitating rapid assessments without overwhelming the user with intricate processes. Additionally, keeping tooling local helps save on cloud costs and avoids vendor lock-in, providing financial benefits and greater control over your environment.

Overall, simplicity in tooling not only accelerates development cycles but also lowers the barrier for adoption, ensuring more developers can leverage Ollama's capabilities effectively at a single-user level within their local environments. This approach minimizes potential technical issues and fosters a more accessible and adaptable development ecosystem, ultimately allowing you to get the job done efficiently and cost-effectively.
