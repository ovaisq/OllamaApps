# **The Benefits of Keeping Tooling Simple with Locally Hosted Ollama**

Using simple, locally hosted tooling with Ollama offers numerous advantages that enhance efficiency and improve the user experience. By focusing on straightforward solutions—such as a Gradio-based single-page code review app or a chatbot powered by tools like ChromaDB or PostgreSQL’s pgvector—developers can streamline their workflows significantly. These applications provide intuitive interfaces that reduce complexity, enabling quick setup and easier maintenance.

A lightweight command-line code review tool, for example, can leverage decision prompts to evaluate entire codebases, boosting productivity by delivering rapid assessments without overwhelming users with intricate processes. Additionally, keeping tooling local helps avoid cloud costs and vendor lock-in, offering financial savings and greater control over your development environment.

Overall, simplicity in tooling not only accelerates development cycles but also lowers the barrier to adoption, ensuring more developers can effectively leverage Ollama’s capabilities in a single-user, local environment. This approach minimizes technical issues, fosters a more accessible and adaptable development ecosystem, and ultimately allows you to work efficiently and cost-effectively.
